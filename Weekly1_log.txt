# Weekly Log — Week 1 (ending 2025-11-09)

Name: Sai Surya Cherupally
Project Title: Dataset Creation using Unitree Go1 Robot

What I Did This Week

I explored how to collect data from the Unitree Go1 robot using its LiDAR and camera.

I learned how to connect to the robot and fetch sensor data.

I tested how the LiDAR records the surroundings and how camera images can be captured.

I started planning an interface that can help automate data collection instead of doing it manually.

I also looked at how to store the data properly so that it can be used later for different research purposes.

Challenges

Understanding how LiDAR data is stored and converted (.pcap files).

Figuring out how to capture camera and LiDAR data at the same time.

Plan for Next Week

Write a simple script to collect LiDAR and camera data automatically.

Try to make both sensors record at the same time.

Collect a small sample dataset for testing.
